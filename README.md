An open-source prosthetic hand system that uses muscle signals and machine learning to provide intuitive control for people with limb loss.

## Overview

This project explores the development of an **affordable, intelligent prosthetic hand** that interprets electromyographic (EMG) signals from residual limb muscles using machine learning. The goal is to create a system that:

- Responds naturally to the user's intended movements
- Learns and adapts to individual muscle patterns
- Costs significantly less than commercial myoelectric prosthetics ($20,000-$100,000+)
- Remains open-source to enable global accessibility and collaboration

**Current Status**: Concept and design phase. This is a research and development project aimed at making advanced prosthetic technology more accessible.

## The Problem

**Traditional prosthetics face major barriers:**

- **Cost**: Advanced myoelectric prosthetics are prohibitively expensive for most people worldwide
- **Control complexity**: Standard systems require extensive training and may not feel intuitive
- **One-size-fits-all**: Limited personalization to individual users' muscle patterns and needs
- **Accessibility**: High costs and proprietary designs limit global availability

**Impact**: Millions of people with limb loss lack access to functional prosthetic technology that could restore independence in daily activities.

## Our Approach

### 1. EMG Signal Detection
- Place surface electrodes on the residual limb to detect electrical signals from muscle contractions
- Capture patterns from multiple muscle groups (typically 4-8 channels)
- These signals represent the user's motor intent, what they're trying to do with their missing hand

### 2. Machine Learning Classification
- Train a lightweight neural network to recognize patterns in EMG signals
- Map specific muscle activation patterns to hand gestures (grip, release, pinch, point, etc.)
- **Personalization**: The system learns each user's unique muscle signatures through calibration
- Continuous adaptation as the user develops muscle memory over time

### 3. Mechanical Response
- Convert classified gestures into precise finger movements using servo motors
- Provide multiple grip patterns suitable for different daily tasks
- Include force sensors to prevent crushing objects or dropping them

### 4. Sensory Feedback
- Use haptic vibration to communicate grip strength back to the user
- Create a closed feedback loop so users can "feel" what the hand is doing
- Visual indicators for system status and modes

## Why This Matters

**For users:**
- Perform daily tasks more naturally (holding utensils, opening doors, typing, etc.)
- Shorter learning curve compared to traditional myoelectric systems
- System improves with use rather than requiring constant retraining

**For the field:**
- Open-source design enables researchers and makers worldwide to contribute
- Lowers the barrier to entry for prosthetic innovation
- Creates a platform for testing new control algorithms and hardware designs

**For accessibility:**
- Target cost: Under $2,000 in materials (vs. $20,000-$100,000 commercial options)
- 3D-printable components can be customized to individual hand sizes
- Open documentation allows local fabrication in resource-limited settings

## Technical Approach

### Signal Processing
EMG signals are noisy and require careful processing:
- **Amplification**: Muscle signals are in the microvolt range and need amplification
- **Filtering**: Remove power line interference (50/60 Hz) and motion artifacts
- **Feature extraction**: Calculate signal strength, frequency content, and temporal patterns
- **Real-time processing**: Must happen fast enough (<100ms) to feel responsive

### Machine Learning Strategy
- **Edge AI**: Run inference directly on the prosthetic's microcontroller (no cloud required)
- **Transfer learning**: Start with a general model, then fine-tune to individual users
- **Lightweight architecture**: Model must be small enough to run on embedded hardware
- **Online adaptation**: Optionally update the model during use based on user feedback

### Mechanical Design Considerations
- **Degrees of freedom**: Balance complexity vs. functionality (5 primary movements)
- **Durability**: Components must withstand daily use and varying loads
- **Weight**: Keep total weight comparable to a natural hand (<500g)
- **Grip patterns**: Support common grips (precision, power, lateral, tripod)

## Key Challenges

**Technical:**
- Achieving low latency between muscle activation and hand movement
- Creating robust signal processing that works across different skin conditions
- Miniaturizing electronics while maintaining processing power
- Battery life sufficient for full-day use

**User-Centered:**
- Socket design and fit (crucial for comfort and signal quality)
- Calibration process must be simple and quick
- System needs to handle signal drift as muscles fatigue
- Providing adequate sensory feedback without complex invasive sensors

**Manufacturing:**
- Sourcing components that are globally available
- Creating assembly instructions accessible to non-experts
- Balancing customization needs with standardized designs
- Quality control without centralized manufacturing

## Potential Impact

**Individual level:**
- Restore ability to perform bimanual tasks (activities requiring two hands)
- Increase independence in self-care, work, and recreation
- Reduce compensatory movements that can cause pain or injury
- Improve quality of life and psychological well-being

**Community level:**
- Enable local prosthetists to provide advanced solutions
- Create opportunities for peer support and shared learning
- Build a knowledge base of design improvements and user experiences

**Global level:**
- Address the estimated 40+ million people who need prosthetic devices but lack access
- Demonstrate that advanced medical technology can be made affordable and open
- Inspire similar open-source approaches to other assistive technologies

## Who This Is For

**Primary users:**
- Individuals with transradial (below-elbow) amputations
- People currently using body-powered or cosmetic prosthetics seeking more functionality
- Those unable to afford commercial myoelectric options

**Contributors:**
- Biomedical engineers and researchers
- Prosthetists and occupational therapists
- Machine learning practitioners interested in edge AI applications
- Makers and hardware enthusiasts
- People with lived experience of limb loss who can provide crucial feedback

## Related Technologies

This project builds on established research in:
- **Myoelectric control**: 70+ years of research on EMG-controlled prosthetics
- **Pattern recognition**: Modern ML has dramatically improved gesture classification
- **Edge computing**: Enables on-device AI that wasn't possible a decade ago
- **Open-source hardware**: Movements like e-NABLE have shown the power of shared designs
- **Adaptive systems**: Real-time learning systems that personalize over time

## Ethical Considerations

**Privacy**: All EMG data and model training should happen on-device; users own their data

**Safety**: The system must fail gracefully (default to safe position if signals are lost)

**Accessibility**: Design choices must prioritize global availability, not just wealthy markets

**User agency**: Users should understand how the system works and be able to modify it

**Clinical validation**: While open-source, proper testing and validation remain essential

## Why Open Source?

Commercial prosthetics are expensive partly because of the research and development costs, but also due to:
- Proprietary designs that prevent competition
- Limited market size for specialized medical devices
- Regulatory compliance costs passed to users

By making this open source:
- Development costs are distributed across a global community
- Innovations can be shared and built upon freely
- Users in any country can access and adapt the technology
- The design improves faster through collaborative iteration

**The goal**: Make advanced prosthetic technology a shared resource, not a luxury product.
